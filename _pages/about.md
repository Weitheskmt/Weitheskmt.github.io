I am currently a doctoral student at [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn), under the guidance of Professor [Wenjie Dou](https://dougroup.westlake.edu.cn). My research focuses on the rapid and precise comprehension, as well as the simulation, of **excited-state dynamics** and **open quantum systems**. I am enthusiastic about delving into the intricate world of quantum phenomena, aiming to unravel the complex behaviors that arise in such systems. With a strong foundation in my academic journey and a passion for pushing the boundaries of knowledge, I am dedicated to contributing to the advancement of our understanding of quantum dynamics and its applications.

Feel free to reach out to me anytime via email:

I'm always open to engaging in discussions, collaborations, and sharing insights within the scientific community.
